            <p>Most of Vaading Notificattion is done through JS and thus not usable but it includes more options in
                terms of positioning. It uses "opened" instead of the default parameter that has two possible values.
                This makes it easier to use and I intend to use it with my component. It also has duration which is
                something I forgot to use. It seems to be a useful addition so I intend to add it to my component as
                well.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://vaadin.com/directory/component/PolymerElementspaper-toast">Paper Toast</a></h2>
            <p>It shares very similar aspects as Vaading but has a text parameter without title or icon. This can be
                simpler to use but it offers much less room for use, so I will not use it in my own componeent.</p>
